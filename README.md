This is crowd & networks homework.<br>

Task is to model the number of members in communities when three elements closure is under consideration.<br>

The detailed algorithm is as follows:<br>

>creating c0 full-connected communities with n0 members.<br>
>creating one new person with the propability of p and create a full-connected community otherwise.<br>
>building relationships with people who already exist following the three-element closure.<br>
>assign the person into one community in which his most friends are with high propability.<br>
>iterate 2000 times to simulate real world.<br>
