This is crowd & networks homework.

Task is to model the number of members in communities when three elements closure is under consideration.

The detailed algorithm is as follows:

  creating c0 full-connected communities with n0 members.

  creating one new person with the propability of p and create a full-connected community otherwise.
  
  building relationships with people who already exist following the three-element closure.
  
  assign the person into one community in which his most friends are with high propability.
  
  iterate 2000 times to simulate real world.
